    <h3>How it Works</h3>
    <p>
      This tool merges <strong>Individual Session Logs</strong> with the
      <strong>Party Hunt Analyzer</strong> to calculate a fair split. It identifies who looted
      creature products, deducts their NPC value from that player's balance, and generates
      instructions to distribute both the physical items and the gold profit evenly among all
      members.
